## Project Overview  
This project aims to investigate possible risk factors for death due to heart failure. 

### Research questions of interest:  
1.  
2.  
3.  

### Dataset:  
Our dataset is called "Heart failure clinical records dataset". This dataset was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r loadData, echo = FALSE}
# make sure csv file is in working directory
data = read.csv("heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv")

```
